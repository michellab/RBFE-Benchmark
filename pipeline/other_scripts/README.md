Notebooks used for the analysis and generation of figures in the manuscript.

Absolute file paths may need to be adjusted. Some analyses require processing of the original trajectory files so will not be able to run.

Other literature results were taken from the repositories described in the main manuscript and the data used for these in the analysis notebooks can be found at their original repository.
