Images of the ligands. Ligands generated using FEGrow denoted by an * .

For the network images, an asterisk indicated perturbations that underwent manual mapping. Perturbations unique to the LOMAP network are shown by teal lines, perturbations unique to the data-driven network by pink lines, and shared perturbations by navy lines. For cmet, syk and hif2a only a LOMAP network was generated and this is shown by black lines.
