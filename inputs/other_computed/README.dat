
Raw edge data was taken from the corresponding github repositories:

openfe - https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/IndustryBenchmarks2024
hahn - https://github.com/dfhahn/protein-ligand-benchmark-analysis
fepplus - https://github.com/schrodinger/public_binding_free_energy_benchmark

The names were processed to match those of this project. For openfe and hahn, the ligand data was obtained by analysing the perturbations with cinnabar, as described in the main manuscript.
