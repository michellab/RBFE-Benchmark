Executable:   /apps/compchem/gromacs/2022.5/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /apps/compchem/gromacs/2022.5
Working dir:  /data/users/carespos/AnnaHerz/cmet/ligands_neutral/system_setup/box_setup
Command line:
  gmx grompp -f ions.mdp -po ions.out.mdp -c solvated.gro -p solvated.top -o ions.tpr


NOTE 1 [file ions.mdp]:
  For a correct single-point energy evaluation with nsteps = 0, use
  continuation = yes to avoid constraining the input coordinates.

Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 12345.00

NOTE 2 [file ions.mdp]:
  You are using a plain Coulomb cut-off, which might produce artifacts.
  You might want to consider using PME electrostatics.
